Here is the HTML markup for a new resume site I'm working on. I'm going to provide a series of prompts to help me write CSS for it. Do you understand?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Joe Casabona - Curriculum Vita</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
			<h1>Joe Casabona</h1>
        <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>

            </ul>
        </nav>

Let's start with colors and fonts. I'd like a pretty muted color scheme — black, white, and some greys — with a single accent color: #fe5e24. For the fonts, I'd like classic print style serif fonts. Can you make some suggestions?

====

Great - let's roll with that. Can we also add a darker grey (maybe #333333) into the color scheme as well. Can you create a set of CSS variables for both the colors and the fonts, as well as the @import code for the fonts?

Can you. make the headings --color-dark-grey instead?

===

OK next, I'd like the entire content to be a max-width of 900px, centered on the page. I'd also like it to have a border using the light grey color, and a subtle shadow. Can you provide the CSS for that?

====

Let's also center the header, and make the navigation into a horizontal layout with each element next to each other. On smaller screens, the navigation should collapse under a button labeled "menu." when clicked or pressed, the menu button should reveal the navigation. Avoid using javascript if you can.

====

Can you also use the dark grey for the header background, adding 40px of padding top and bottom, and invert the header's font colors to make the readable on a dark background.
