Long gone are the days of learning code from books. Even electronic and online resources are becoming less popular. Now, artificial intelligence is a go-to tool for writing basic code, and while it has many advantages, it’s not without its own challenges. For one, while AI can help with the basics of coding, it still needs a knowledgeable user. In this course, Joe Casbona shows you how AI tools can help speed up your entire process. With the rapid development of generative AI tools, it’s important for web developers to understand how these tools work, and how they can be leveraged for prototyping, layout creation, testing, and more.
